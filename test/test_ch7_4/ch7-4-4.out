--- input memo lines, and then input empty line at the end ---
The Vector class implements a growable array of objects. 
Like an array, it contains components that can be accessed 
using an integer index. However, the size of a Vector can 
grow or shrink as needed to accommodate adding and removing 
items after the Vector has been created.
Each vector tries to optimize storage management by maintaining 
a capacity and a capacityIncrement. The capacity is always 
at least as large as the vector size; it is usually larger 
because as components are added to the vector, the vector's 
storage increases in chunks the size of capacityIncrement. 
An application can increase the capacity of a vector 
before inserting a large number of components; 
this reduces the amount of incremental reallocation.
The iterators returned by this class's iterator and 
listIterator methods are fail-fast: if the vector is 
structurally modified at any time after the iterator 
is created, in any way except through the iterator's 
own remove or add methods, the iterator will throw 
a ConcurrentModificationException. 
Thus, in the face of concurrent modification, 
the iterator fails quickly and cleanly, 
rather than risking arbitrary, non-deterministic behavior 
at an undetermined time in the future. 
The Enumerations returned by the elements method are not fail-fast; 
if the Vector is structurally modified at any time 
after the enumeration is created then the results of 
enumerating are undefined.
Note that the fail-fast behavior of an iterator cannot be 
guaranteed as it is, generally speaking, impossible to 
make any hard guarantees in the presence of unsynchronized 
concurrent modification. 
Fail-fast iterators throw ConcurrentModificationException 
on a best-effort basis. 
Therefore, it would be wrong to write a program that 
depended on this exception for its correctness: 
the fail-fast behavior of iterators should be used only to detect bugs.
As of the Java 2 platform v1.2, 
this class was retrofitted to implement the List interface, 
making it a member of the Java Collections Framework. 
Unlike the new collection implementations, Vector is synchronized. 
If a thread-safe implementation is not needed, 
it is recommended to use ArrayList in place of Vector.
