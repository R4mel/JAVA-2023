[0] The Last of the Mohicans
[1] James Fenimore Cooper
[2] Author's Introduction
[3] It is believed that the scene of this tale, and most of the information
[4] necessary to understand its allusions, are rendered sufficiently 
[5] obvious to the reader in the text itself, or in the accompanying notes.
[6] Still there is so much obscurity in the Indian traditions, and so much
[7] confusion in the Indian names, as to render some explanation useful.
[8] Few men exhibit greater diversity, or, if we may so express it, 
[9] greater antithesis of character, 
[10] than the native warrior of North America.
